## Overview

Based on the design, it might use a lot of css and javascript. This challenge was given by frontendMentor. It is totally free! and very good for improving your frontend skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
Without bootstrap, progress is a bit tough. but it's a great experience. Menu bar and making it responsive without bootstrap were the hardest part for me. I have to recode most of the code. changing tags with the suitable one etc etc..

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- jQuery
- Javascript

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<p>none for noe :)</p>
```
```css
li:nth-child(5) /*get the 5th child of the list!*/

.extra-info > :nth-child(1)

/*
  - Descendant Selector (space)
  - Child Selector (>)
  - Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
  - General Sibling Selector (~)
*/
```
```js
const vPort = window.innerWidth; -- //system checks for the viewport

if (menu.hasClass("showMenu")) - //to check for the existence of a class in an id or class
```
